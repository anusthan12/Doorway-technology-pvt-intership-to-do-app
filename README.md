The Doorway Technology Pvt Internship To-Do App is a web application that has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to help users organize and manage their tasks effectively. Let's delve into the details of each technology involved:

1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
HTML is the backbone of web development and is responsible for the structural elements of a web page. In the To-Do App, HTML is used to create the layout and structure of the user interface. It defines the various elements such as text fields, buttons, lists, and containers required to build the app.

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
CSS is used to enhance the visual appearance of the web page created with HTML. It allows developers to apply styles, such as colors, fonts, margins, and paddings, to the HTML elements. In the To-Do App, CSS is utilized to create an appealing and user-friendly interface, improving the overall look and feel of the application.

3. JavaScript:
JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. It enables developers to create responsive elements and implement logic for various actions. In the To-Do App, JavaScript plays a crucial role in handling user interactions, such as adding new tasks, marking tasks as complete, deleting tasks, and updating the task list dynamically.

By combining these three technologies, the Doorway Technology Pvt Internship To-Do App provides users with an interactive and visually pleasing interface where they can manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, organize them into categories, mark them as complete, and remove completed tasks. The app dynamically updates the task list, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Overall, this internship project demonstrates the practical implementation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a functional web application for task management.
